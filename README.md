## FORM
In ```HTML```, a ```form``` is an element that allows users to input and submit data to a web server.
It typically contains various types of ```input fields```, such as text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons,
dropdown lists, and buttons, which enable users to enter information such as their name,
email address, password, etc. Once the user has completed the form, they can submit it by
clicking the ```submit button```, which sends the data to the server for processing.
